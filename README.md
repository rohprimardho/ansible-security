# ansible-security

This role is useful to kick off an empty server. It takes care of the hostname and also the basic "best practice" related to SSH. I am actually also playing around with ansible-vault, but it does not seem to be as safe as I thought it would be. Therefore I don't commit "secured.yml" here. But you get the point. :)
